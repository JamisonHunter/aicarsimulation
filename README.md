# What I Learned
Throughout coding this project, I learned a great deal about the following.
* Object Oriented Programming
* The basics of neural networks
* The syntax of JavaScript

Throughout the project, I documented the code in order to gain a better understanding of what precisely was occuring under the hood. Overall, this project was an interesting learning experience!
